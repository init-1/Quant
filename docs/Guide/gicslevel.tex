Controls to what level in \mcode{GICS} the neutralization is performed.

                 Standard GICS code consists of 8 digits, a form of like \mcode{25203010}.
                 The first 2 (\mcode{25} in the previous example) refer to \textbf{sector},
                 the next 2 (\mcode{20}) to \textbf{industry group},
                 the 5-6th (\mcode{30}) to \textbf{industry},
                 and the last 2 (\mcode{10}) to \textbf{sub-industry}.
                 Correspondingly, the value of level can be:
                 0: NO neutralization;
                 1: sector;
                 2: industry group; 
                 3: industry;
                 or 4: sub-industry.
                 \emph{Default} is 1.
                 Note that it is only effective when \mcode{GICS} being provided.

                 \mcode{level} can also be \mcode{'customized'}, 
                 used with non-standard \mcode{GICS} passed by user.
                 In this case, the neutralization will be performed based on all digits of 
                 the non-standard gics code.
